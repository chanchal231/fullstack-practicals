      Bootstrap is a HTML, CSS & JS Library that focuses on simplifying the
      development of informative web pages (as opposed to web apps). The primary
      purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of
      color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor
      is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking.
      Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for
      all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables
      and form elements across web browsers. In addition, developers can take
      advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize the
      appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for
      light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes,
      and text with a highlight. Bootstrap also comes with several JavaScript
      components in the form of jQuery plugins. They provide additional user
      interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, and carousels. Each
      Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and
      in some cases accompanying JavaScript code.
